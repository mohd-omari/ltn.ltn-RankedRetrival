# ltn.ltn-RankedRetrival
simple ranked retreival system written in python 


• f1,f2,f3,f4,f5 are sample documents 

• lib.py is a collection of libraries that are used in information retrival generally (I didn't use them all),
I copied them from this repository https://github.com/williamscott701/Information-Retrieval/blob/master/2.%20TF-IDF%20Ranking%20-%20Cosine%20Similarity%2C%20Matching%20Score/TF-IDF.ipynb 

• run the main.py file to use the Ranked retrieval model
